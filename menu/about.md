title: Welcome to Lagrange!

LBroadly interested in picking arcane ML research, engineering a real-world solution around it and making it achieve commercial success. My current area of focus is natural language understanding, image retrieval and engineering serverless data-pipelines on Google Cloud Platform. 

I am a Solutions Architect at [Quantiphi Inc](https://www.quantiphi.com/) and currently split my time between Mumbai and Sunnyvale, California. Most of my work spans collaborating with clients to build product roadmaps, running large-scale deep learning experiments and designing scalable systems for serving models in production.

Through my writings, I wish to distill some practical concepts and strategies that Iâ€™ve been fortunate to learn along the way through my interaction with terrific engineers at Google and running many failed experiments.
