Effective writing is often elusive not because a writer has a fuzzy thought process but because there’s tension between capturing the optimal level of detail, managing style and quality of presentation. How do you weigh each aspect while communicating an important idea?

One of my mentors from the Bay Area, had an interesting take on writing on the internet. He visualized communication shouldn’t be viewed as a unidirectional transfer of information from the speaker to the reader but as a circular loop. It begins with the writer’s message, the message hits the reader, elucidates a response which is fed back to the writer. Now the second time this loop runs it must be marginally different than the previous time. 

A great starting point is to understand your target audience. Background of the readers is definitely a variable one must gauge. For most of my writing on this blog it is deterministic: I write for computing enthusiasts interested in becoming makers of technology. However the most fundamental commonalities between readers of any technology blog today is as follows: 
* They're time-constrained and often looking to squeeze that hour of learning into their busy schedule
* They’re content driven
* They’re looking for actionable solutions
 
For readers with busy schedules looking to build large-scale ML systems, my writing presents a distillation of some practical concepts and strategies I’ve learnt along the way through my interaction with terrific engineers at Google and running many failed experiments. Morever, this blog is a commitment to distilling and deepening my own understanding of self and subjet matter both.
